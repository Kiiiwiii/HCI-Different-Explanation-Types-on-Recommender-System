%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
This paper provides a literature overview of explanations in recommender systems.
It introduced two standards/criteria on how to design and evaluate explanations in recommender systems.
In general, the type of explanations depends on the goal of the system.
For example, in some scenarios, like in a driving context, pages of explanations might not be suitable. In this case,
drivers may prefer brief explanations. In order to find possible criteria for it, we extracted some principles from two recent studies and what we have found is that \textbf{efficiency}, \textbf{persuasiveness} and \textbf{why} question-type-based explanations might be suitable for brief explanations. However, more studies need to be done in order to explore other possible criteria for it.
