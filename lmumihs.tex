%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
This paper provides a literatural overview of explanations in personalization and recommender systems.
It then introduced two standards/criterion on how to design and evaluate explanations in recommender systems.
Which type of explanations the system should offer to users depends on the goal of the system.
And in some scenarios, like in a driving context, pages of explanations might not be suitable. In this case,
short explanations is preferred. In order to explore possible criterion of short explanations, two studies were
introduced and what we have found is that \textbf{efficiency}, \textbf{persuasiveness} and \textbf{why} question-type-based
explanations might be suitable for short explanations. However, some more studies need to be done in order to
check the validity of other criterion in short explanations.
